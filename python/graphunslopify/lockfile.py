"""One appearance per series, shared by every figure in a paper.

`series_order` fixes colour assignment inside a single spec. Across figure 1 and
figure 7 there was nothing, so a model could be blue in one and orange in the
next, which quietly undoes the argument that the generator owning presentation
makes figures agree.

The lock file is the missing piece. First figure to mention a series claims an
appearance for it; every figure after that reads the same one. It is plain JSON
and belongs in version control next to the paper.
