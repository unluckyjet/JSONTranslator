 * What the figure is supposed to show, stated so the data can be asked.

 * The integrity literature keeps describing the same failure. A caption asserts
 * a gain while the axis is truncated, or says "consistently outperforms" over a
 * chart where it does not. Neither is visible to a pixel checker, because the
 * checker cannot read the manuscript, and neither is visible to a spec checker,
 * because the spec does not carry the claim.
 *
 * So the spec carries the claim, and the generated script tests it against the
 * data before the figure is written. A claim that fails is an error before
 * submission rather than a comment from reviewer two.
